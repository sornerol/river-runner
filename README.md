[Play _River Runner_ on itch.io](https://sornerol.itch.io/river-runner)

River Runner is a remake of Carol Shaw's classic Atari 2600 game _River Raid_.

## Building from source
River Runner is built in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 3.4.4 Mono version. To build, simply install Godot if you haven't already, then clone this repo and open the project in Godot.

## Contributing
This project was meant to be a bit of a learning excercise for me, so I don't have any immediate plans to continue development on River Runner. However, feel free to submit feature requests, bug reports, or pull requests.
